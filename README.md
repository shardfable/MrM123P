ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrM123P<br> 
I'm an aspiring programmer, currently learning javascript because it's cool to use with html and css to create websites and you can do pretty creative stuff with it but I also want to learn c# because of unity, if you have any suggestions on languages that could increese my versatility and bring my creativity to life, i'd be glad for some adivces (my discord is @mrm123p)<br>
My biggest fear is jokingly that I'll have to learn php and seriously that I'll either end up dropping programming or being not good enough at it<br>
My main inspiration for starting the journey to become at least somewhat decent programmer's been GD Colon<br>
I hope to see myslef making some cool projects or at least being something, especially since programming is something I find fun (at least for now ðŸ˜…)<br>
